Load balancing of a software-defined network with Ryu

A Software defined network based on mininet with two controllers that communicate over IP/TCP to exchange information of the network.

The paper SDN_project.pdf explains our work extensively. My part included mult_ctrl_topo.py, SDN_gui.py, the bash-scripts 
and a minor part of SDN_simple_switch_c1.py respectively SDN_simple_switch_c2.py which we adapted to our needs from the original python-file simple_switch_13.py ( https://github.com/osrg/ryu/blob/master/ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py )
